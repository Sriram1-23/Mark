        <p>Born and raised in a Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, Kalam studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He was known as the "Missile Man of India" for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, India's second such test after the first test in 1974.

            Kalam was elected as the president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. He was widely referred to as the "People's President". He engaged in teaching, writing and public service after his presidency. He was a recipient of several awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.</p>

        <p> After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam became a member of the Defence Research & Development Service and joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) as a scientist. During his early career, he was involved in the design of small hovercraft, and remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.[20] Later, he joined the Indian National Committee for Space Research, working under renowned space scientist Vikram Sarabhai.[3] He was interviewed and recruited into Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) by H. G. S. Murthy, the first director of the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station.[21]

            In 1969, Kalam transferred to ISRO where he became the project director of India's first satellite launch vehicle (SLV) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980. He had earlier started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.[22] In 1969, Kalam received the approval from the Government of India to expand the programme to include more engineers.[19] In 1963–64, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, and Wallops Flight Facility.[2][23] Since the late 1970s, Kalam was part of the effort to develop the SLV-3 and Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), both of which were successful.[24][25]</p>

        <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabin Abdul Kalam, a boy from Rameshwaram who dreamt of touching the sky by becoming a pilot, ended up being one of the most popular Presidents of India. Always an academician, Kalam was well known for his books, contributions to science, and being a motivational speaker.
            Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931 in Rameshwaram in Tamil Nadu. During his school years, he supported his family by selling newspapers. After completing his schooling from Rameshwaram, Kalam graduated in Aerospace Engineering from Madras Institute of Technology in 1960 and joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) as a scientist. Though Kalam wanted to become a fighter pilot, he missed the chance by one position. However, he became a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS) and started his career by designing a small hovercraft.
            In 1969 Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he established himself as the “missile man of India”. Kalam became the Project Director of first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) of India in 1980.
            In 1982, Kalam became the Chief Scientific Advisor to the Prime Minister of India and also the Secretary of DRDO. He also served as the Chief Project Coordinator in the Pokhran-II Nuclear Test along with R Chidambaram. It was after media’s intervention that Indian people came to know about Kalam’s achievements and he became the most successful and popular scientist of India.
            Kalam along, with cardiologist Sonam Raju, invented a low-cost coronary stent which was named as Kalam-Raju stent. They both also designed a rugged tablet PC to ensure health care in rural areas which was named as “Kalam Raju Tablet”.
